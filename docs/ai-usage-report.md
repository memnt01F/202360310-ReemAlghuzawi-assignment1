# AI Usage Report – Assignment 1

## Tools Used & Use Cases

### ChatGPT
ChatGPT was used as the primary AI tool during this assignment. It supported the development process in the following ways:

- **Code Generation:** Generated initial templates for CSS styling and JavaScript interactivity.
- **Debugging Support:** Helped identify why certain elements (such as images and theme toggle) were not working properly.
- **Documentation Support:** Assisted in organizing and writing the README file. 
- **Code Commenting:** Helped add clear comments to improve readability and professionalism of the code.

No other AI tools were used in this assignment.

## Benefits & Challenges

### Benefits
- Accelerated the initial setup of the project.
- Provided structured examples of responsive layouts using CSS Grid and Flexbox.
- Helped implement a working theme toggle feature with `localStorage`.
- Improved clarity and organization in documentation.
- Reduced time spent debugging minor issues.

### Challenges
- Some generated solutions were more complex than required for a foundation-level assignment.
- Certain styling suggestions needed simplification to maintain a clean and minimal design.
- It was necessary to carefully review suggestions to ensure alignment with assignment requirements.

## Learning Outcomes

Using AI during this assignment helped me:

- Better understand how CSS Grid and Flexbox work for layout design.
- Learn how JavaScript event listeners interact with DOM elements.
- Understand how `localStorage` can store user preferences.
- Improve my ability to structure files and organize a web project.
- Develop stronger skills in reviewing and refining generated code rather than relying on it blindly.

The experience reinforced the importance of understanding the logic behind AI-generated suggestions.

## Responsible Use & Modifications

To ensure correctness, originality, and academic integrity:

- I reviewed all AI-generated code before implementing it.
- I modified styling and simplified certain features to match the assignment scope.
- I tested all features locally before finalizing the project.
- I removed unnecessary complexity to keep the design clean and aligned with the instructions.
- Adjusting JavaScript event listeners to match the custom toggle switch structure.
- Fixing image path issues by understanding local vs. GitHub environments.
